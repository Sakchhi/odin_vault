Command-line utility to read screenshots and write to text file


This project is a command-line utility to extract text from screenshots. It uses the pytesseract package, which is a wrapper around Google-ocr.

It can read a single file or iterate through all images in a directory. Text extracted is printed to console and also written to a text file in outputs directory.

Future plans:
> Upload image from browser to be processed using a Flask API
> Android app maybe
> Analysis on extracted content
